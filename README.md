### Bhargav Kulkarni
I am a PhD student @ the University of Utah advised by Prof. Pavel Panchekha.

My goal is to make it easier for developers to write more correct and more robust code. To that end I have been currently working on sound attribution of floating point error in floating point programs

Beyond that I love hacking away at programming languages, and rewriting applications from scratch (my website is powered by bespoke SSG).
