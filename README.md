### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Bhargav Kulkarni
I really like theoretical Computer Science, and am currently working with [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/). I love coding Interpreters and Compilers and tools involving lexing and parsing. I also like working on Python scripts. I hope you find something useful in my account.

You can find my resume here: [https://bit.ly/bhargav_resume](https://bit.ly/bhargav_resume)
